# pacman
## This is a useful link on how to build pacman, and make it simply running through your screen.
The information about how to actually run it, is given through comments over the functions, and it can be read on pacman.js. The index.html file is the one that uses the javascript information to acutally create the magic.
If you want to find further information about it, or discuss some issues, feel free to contact me. My information can be found under: https://lvoliveira1.gihub.com
